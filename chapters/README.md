# Workbook chapters

Most workbook chapter tasks should be solved in the directory ~/src/tasks/workbook/chapters and pushed to Git on the main branch when completed. Exceptions are Chapter 5, Chapter 15 and full scale labs which have dedicated repositories or folders.
You may use any file/folder structure that suits you for all other workbook chapters, but I recommend that you create one folder per chapter.
